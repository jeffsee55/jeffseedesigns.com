    <hr>
    <p>When not in front of my computer I spend my hours running on the roads of upstate South Carolina, training for the 2016 Olympics. After having come within a few spots of making it to London in 2012, Iâ€™ve become even more committed to that goal. Web design and running are my yin and yang and I am continually approaching each with excitement and enthusiasm.</p>
